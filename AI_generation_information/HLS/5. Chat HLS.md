# Floating point operations
At this stage, the HLS C code functioned as expected, successfully passing the C Simulation, Synthesis C/RTL, cosimulation, and was accurately exported to RTL. However, the generated code incorporated a range of Xilinx IP components. Unfortunately, this limitation prevented the RTL code from being synthesized using any software outside of the Xilinx suite.

Upon delving deeper into these IPs, it was discovered that the primary reason for their creation was the use of the float data type. To address this limitation and showcase the full potential of AI, we developed several floating-point functions.

The subsequent sections detail the design and implementation of these functions. They process the float16 data type as int16 and perform floating-point operations at the bit level.
